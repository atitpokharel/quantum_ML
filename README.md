# **Quantum_ML Repository**

## **Overview**
The Quantum_ML repository is a collection of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning applications designed to showcase the integration of quantum computing with traditional machine learning frameworks. Each module explores the application of quantum circuits for solving complex problems in various domains. 

In particular, the repository emphasizes **Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs)**, which leverage parameterized quantum gates to optimize tasks through iterative classical-quantum feedback loops. VQCs are especially effective for machine learning tasks, such as classification and feature extraction, due to their ability to process data in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. By integrating VQCs, this repository highlights the advantages of quantum computing in enhancing computational efficiency and solving problems intractable for classical systems.
